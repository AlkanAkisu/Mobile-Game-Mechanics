# Mobile Game Mechanics
In this repo I will try to create/clone well known mobile game mechanics.

## Game Mechanics I Created
### **I. Idle and Tile Placing**
This project completed in 3 days for intern application
- Player can buy buildings with resources
- Player can move and rotate building to a map and build them
- Can earn resources by time
- I used ScriptableObjects to make it more designer friendly

### **II. Match Three**
This project completed in roughly 2 days;
- Player can match three or more fruits by swiping to a right position
- There is a randomise algorithm working in the back for creating new tiles. This algoritmhs reduces creation of consecutive tiles
- You can earn score by matching tiles
- I used ScriptableObjects for tiles and tilemaps. So designer create new tiles with different visuals and different tile maps.
